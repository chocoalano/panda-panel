 * of those values is validated against the schema before it touches the
 * builder: an unknown sort column, an out-of-range perPage, or an
 * unrecognised filter is ignored rather than passed through.
 *
 * This layer never starts a query. It receives the resource's own query so
 * tenant, module, and permission scopes stay applied.
 *
 * A namespace moves the whole state under one query-string key
 * (`?relations[posts][sort]=title`). A record page can carry several relation
 * tables at once, and each has to be able to sort and paginate without
 * touching the others — a shared `?page=` would move all of them together.
