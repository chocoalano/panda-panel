/**
 * Whether the server is allowed to send a request somewhere.
 *
 * This screen lets a panel user type a URL that the *server* then requests.
 * That is server-side request forgery by construction, and it is not a
 * hypothetical: `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-
 * credentials/` is one text field away from handing an admin the machine's
 * cloud credentials, and `http://localhost:6379` reaches a Redis that is
 * bound to loopback precisely because it was assumed unreachable.
 *
 * Two independent gates, and a URL has to pass both:
 *
 * 1. **The host is on the allowlist**, which is empty by default. Deny by
 *    default rather than allow: a panel installed and never configured can
 *    reach nothing at all, and adding a destination is a deploy rather than a
 *    form submission.
 * 2. **The address is public.** Checked after the allowlist and again at
 *    request time, because a name on the allowlist can still resolve into the
 *    private range — by mistake, or by a DNS record whose owner changed it
 *    after it was approved.
 *
 * The second check is what makes the first safe to relax. An operator who
 * turns the allowlist off still cannot reach their own network.
