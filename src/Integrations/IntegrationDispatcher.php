/**

 *
 * Nothing here can stop a write. A `before` trigger fires just before the
 * record is saved and a `after` one just after, and in both cases the
 * response is recorded and then dropped: an integration is a notification,
 * not a gate. That is the difference between an endpoint going down and an
 * endpoint going down *and nobody being able to save anything* — and the
 * second is not a failure mode worth having for the sake of the first.
 *
 * Every send is checked against `OutboundUrl` again here, not only when the
 * integration was saved. A hostname approved last week can resolve somewhere
 * else today, and the check that matters is the one nearest the socket.
