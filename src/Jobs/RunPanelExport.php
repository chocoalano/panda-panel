 * choice: an Eloquent builder holds a closure and cannot be serialized, so a
 * job that took "the query" would fail the moment it was queued. It takes the
 * description of a query instead — the resource, the table state the list was
 * showing, or an explicit selection — and rebuilds it on the other side.
 *
 * Rebuilding through the same `TableQuery` the list uses is what keeps the
 * file honest: the rows in it are the rows that were on screen, filters and
 * search included, rather than everything the resource can see.
