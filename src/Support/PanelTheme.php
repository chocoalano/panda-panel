/**
 * A panel's colours, as CSS custom properties.
 *
 * Not an enum, and deliberately unlike `BadgeColor`. Those are *semantic* —
 * success, danger, warning — a closed set because each maps to a literal
 * Tailwind class the build has to have seen. These are the theme: the values
 * behind `--primary`, `--background`, and the rest, which shadcn already
 * reads as custom properties. A custom property is set at runtime by
 * definition, so a panel can carry its own without anything being compiled.
 *
 * That split is the whole design. A colour that names a *meaning* is closed,
 * because meanings are finite and each needs a class. A colour that names a
 * *value* is open, because it never becomes a class.
 *
 * Values are validated before they cross. These end up inside a `style`
 * attribute, so a string that is a stylesheet rather than a colour would be
 * rendered as one — the same reason `ColorEntry` validates.
