/**
 * What the application got, when it published, so an upgrade can tell an edit
 * from a stale copy.
 *
 * ## The problem this solves
 *
 * The panel's frontend is published into the application rather than imported
 * from the package, and that is the right trade — a component you cannot see
 * the source of is a component you cannot debug, and the build-time
 * `import.meta.glob` registries require it. But it costs something real, and
 * the cost is the whole of this class: **once a file is the application's, a
 * package update cannot improve it.**
 *
 * With no record of what was published, an upgrade has two options and both
 * are bad. Re-publishing without `--force` skips every file, so nothing
 * updates. Re-publishing *with* `--force` overwrites everything, including the
 * files the project deliberately changed. Neither can tell the difference,
 * because "the file on disk differs from the package's" is true in both cases.
 *
 * ## Three hashes, not two
 *
 * The missing piece is the same one `git merge-base` supplies: a record of the
 * common ancestor. With the hash the file had *when it was published*, three
 * values answer the question exactly:
 *
 * | on disk | in package | means | what an update does |
 * | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 * | = manifest | = manifest | unchanged both sides | nothing |
 * | = manifest | ≠ manifest | stale, never edited | **overwrite, safely** |
 * | ≠ manifest | = manifest | you edited it, nothing upstream | leave alone |
 * | ≠ manifest | ≠ manifest | **conflict** — both changed | report, never touch |
 * | absent | present | you deleted it | leave alone |
 * | not in manifest | present | new since you published | **write it** |
 * | in manifest | absent | no longer shipped | report as removable |
 *
 * Only two rows are written automatically, and both are ones where the
 * application demonstrably has no opinion about the file. A conflict is
 * reported with its path and never resolved by guessing — that is a diff for
 * a person to read.
 *
 * ## What the recorded hash is
 *
 * The ancestor, and an ancestor is a point on the *package's* history: the
 * version of the package's copy that the application's copy was last brought
 * level with. It is never a hash of the application's own content.
 *
 * Getting that backwards is what PP-41 was. `write()` hashed the copy on disk,
 * so an update recorded a locally modified file's own edit as its ancestor.
 * The package's copy then no longer matched the ancestor while the disk copy
 * did — which is the definition of `stale`, the one state an update overwrites
 * without asking. Every deliberate customisation survived exactly one release,
 * and a `conflict` was quietly downgraded to a file safe to throw away.
 *
 * So the ancestor moves on exactly two occasions, and both are decisions:
 * a file was overwritten from the package, or `reconcile()` was told by name
 * that somebody merged it. An update that touched nothing records nothing.
 *
 * ## Getting out of a conflict
 *
 * `--force` resolves a conflict by discarding the application's copy, which is
 * an answer but not a merge. `reconcile()` is the other one: the person merges
 * the two copies themselves, then names the file, and the ancestor moves to
 * the package version they merged against while the content stays theirs. The
 * file reads as `modified` afterwards — ours, and level with upstream.
 *
 * ## Where it lives
 *
 * `.panel-assets.json` at the application's root, and it belongs in the
 * application's repository: it is a record of a decision the project made, in
 * the same way `composer.lock` is. Under `bootstrap/cache` it would be
 * regenerated and useless; under `storage` it would be gitignored and lost on
 * the first deploy.
 *
 * ## What it covers
 *
 * Everything `PublishedAssets::files()` lists: the frontend always, and the
 * translations from the moment an application publishes them to
 * `lang/vendor/panda-panel`. Both are files the application owns once they
 * are on disk, and both had the same failure without a record — a reworded
 * confirmation frozen at the release it was published from is the same bug as
 * a stale component, and reads exactly as "the package never fixed that".
 *
 * A translation that was never published is not tracked and does not need to
 * be: the package's own copy is what the translator reads, so it cannot fall
 * behind.

     * The recorded hash is the ancestor, and an ancestor is only meaningful as
     * a point on the package's history — the version the application's copy
     * was last brought level with. It is never the application's own content.
     *
     * That distinction is the whole of PP-41. This used to hash the copy on
     * disk for every file, so an update recorded a locally modified file's own
     * edit as its ancestor. The file then read as `stale` on the next run — the
     * package's copy no longer matches an ancestor that is now the edit — and
     * `stale` is the one state an update overwrites without asking. Every
     * deliberate customisation survived exactly one release, and a conflict was
     * quietly downgraded to a file safe to throw away.
     *
     * So a file is recorded against the package only when the application
     * demonstrably has the package's copy:
     *
     * | on disk | recorded as | why |
     * | --- | --- | --- |
     * | identical to the package | the package's hash | reconciled, by having the same bytes |
     * | differs, nothing recorded | its own hash | no ancestor exists to preserve |
     * | differs, ancestor recorded | the ancestor, untouched | ours; this run did not reconcile it |
     * | absent, ancestor recorded | the ancestor, untouched | deleted on purpose, and it stays deleted |
     *
     * Row three is what a `modified` and a `conflict` file take, and it is why
     * an update can be run as often as you like without moving anything the
     * application owns. Row four used to drop the record, which turned a file
     * deleted on purpose into a `new` one and wrote it straight back.
     *
     * A file that was just overwritten from the package — `stale`, `new`, or a
     * `--force`d conflict — is identical to the package by the time this runs,
     * so it takes row one and rebases onto the version it just received. That
     * is the only way an ancestor moves on its own; every other move is
     * `reconcile()`, which a person asks for by name.
