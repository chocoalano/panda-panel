/**
 * What the published frontend needs from the application around it.
 *
 * Every panel screen is a Vue component that reaches an application by
 * `vendor:publish` and is built by that application's Vite. Three things have
 * to be true for that to work, and none of them is something this package can
 * do on its behalf:
 *
 * 1. **npm dependencies.** The components import sixteen packages. The list
 *    lives in this repository's own `package.json` and is read from there
 *    rather than restated here — a second copy is a copy that goes stale the
 *    first time a component imports something new.
 *
 * 2. **The host seam.** Eighteen modules the components import and do not
 *    ship: `@/routes/*` and `@/actions/*`, which Wayfinder generates from the
 *    application's own routes, and a handful of components a Laravel Vue
 *    starter kit already has. See `frontend/host/README.md` in this
 *    repository for why each one is the application's rather than ours.
 *
 * 3. **Vite.** No entrypoint, no build.
 *
 * Getting any of them wrong fails at `npm run build`, in a message about a
 * module specifier — which is a true error about the wrong thing. Checking
 * here turns each into a sentence naming what to install.
