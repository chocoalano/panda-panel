/**
 * Where a signed-in user is sent when they land on the application's own
 * dashboard.
 *
 * A starter kit ships `/dashboard` and points Fortify's post-login redirect
 * at it. Installing a panel does not change either, so the first thing a
 * developer sees after `panel:install` is the starter kit's empty placeholder
 * and a panel they have to reach by typing its URL. That is the single worst
 * moment in the install, and it is not something the application did wrong.
 *
 * The counterpart to `PanelLoginRedirect`: that one sends a guest *out* of a
 * panel to the right login, this one sends a signed-in user *into* the panel
 * they would have had to find. Both are redirects rather than edits — nothing
 * here rewrites a route file or overwrites a component the application owns.
 *
 * Answers null, and so changes nothing, for every request that is not one of
 * the configured paths, for a guest, for a user no panel will admit, and for
 * a request that is already inside a panel — the last of which is what stops
 * a panel mounted at `/dashboard` redirecting to itself forever.
