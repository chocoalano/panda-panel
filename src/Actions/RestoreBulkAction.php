 * containing one forbidden record restores nothing rather than restoring the
 * permitted ones and failing halfway.
 *
 * A record in the selection that is not trashed is left alone rather than
 * refused. The user selected rows and asked for them to be restored; the ones
 * already live are in the state that was asked for.
