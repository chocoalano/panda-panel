/**
 * Refuses a plugin built against a version of this framework that no longer
 * exists.
 *
 * The failure this replaces is the reason it is worth having. A plugin
 * calling a panel method that was removed fails with `Call to undefined
 * method Panel::whatever()`, somewhere inside a request, naming the framework
 * rather than the plugin — and the person reading it has no way to know which
 * of their four plugins asked for it, or which version of that plugin they
 * are on.
 *
 * Checked at registration, which is the earliest moment the answer is knowable
 * and the last moment before the plugin starts changing the panel.
 *
 * ## When the check is skipped, and why that is right
 *
 * Three cases, all of which mean "there is no question to answer":
 *
 * - The plugin declared no constraint. Most plugins do not, and a plugin that
 *   has not thought about compatibility should not be treated as if it had.
 * - This framework is not installed as a composer package — which is exactly
 *   the situation in its own repository and test suite. There is no version
 *   to compare against, and inventing one would fail every plugin here.
 * - The version is a branch alias like `dev-main`. A constraint cannot be
 *   evaluated against a branch, and refusing every plugin on a development
 *   checkout would make the framework untestable against its own ecosystem.
