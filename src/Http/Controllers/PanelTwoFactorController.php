 *
 * A session-level challenge rather than part of the login POST. Fortify owns
 * signing in — its rate limiting, its passkeys, its TOTP — and reaching into
 * that pipeline to add a channel would mean owning a fork of it. This works
 * the way password confirmation does instead: the session is marked once the
 * code is answered, and the panel's own middleware holds every page until it
 * is.
 *
 * The mark is a timestamp in the session, so it dies with the session. A
 * second factor that survived signing out would not be one.
