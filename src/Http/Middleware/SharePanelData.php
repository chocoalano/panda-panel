/**
 * The props every panel screen is built from.
 *
 * The panel's frontend cannot render without these: the shell reads `panel`,
 * the sidebar reads `navigation`, the header reads `panels`, `search`, and
 * `notifications`, and the toast listener reads `broadcasting`. They belong to
 * the package for the same reason the components do — an application that had
 * to hand-copy them would be maintaining the panel's internals, and a version
 * that added a prop would break every application that forgot to.
 *
 * The application's own `HandleInertiaRequests` is untouched. This shares
 * through `Inertia::share()`, which merges, so `auth`, `errors`, and whatever
 * else the application shares all still arrive.
 *
 * Every value is a closure. A request that never reaches a panel pays for none
 * of them, and nothing here is ever cached: visibility, badge counts, active
 * state, and the unread count are all per-user and per-URL.
