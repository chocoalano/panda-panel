 *
 * The relation is the scope, and `query()` is the only way to reach a related
 * record — exactly the role `Resource::query()` plays for a resource. That is
 * what makes a key from another owner a 404 here rather than a record the
 * manager will happily edit: the query never starts from the related model,
 * it starts from `$owner->{relationship}()`.
 *
 * Authorization asks two different questions and keeps them apart. Reading and
 * writing the related *record* are abilities on that record's own policy;
 * attaching and detaching are abilities on the *owner's* policy, because
 * whether a tag may be pinned to a post is the post's business, not the tag's.
