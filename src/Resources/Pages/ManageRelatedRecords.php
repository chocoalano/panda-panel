/**
 * A page devoted to one of a record's relations.
 *
 * The same manager a record page can show inline, given its own route and its
 * own place in the record's sub-navigation. Which of the two to use is a
 * question about the relation, not about the framework: a handful of rows
 * belongs beside the record, and a table somebody will page and search
 * through deserves a URL of its own.
 *
 * Declared in `Resource::pages()` like every other page, so it is routed,
 * named, and authorized by the same machinery:
 *
 * ```php
 * 'posts' => ManageUserPosts::class,
 * ```
 *
 * with the page naming the manager and a `{record}` in its route path.
