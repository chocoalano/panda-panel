/**
 * Tells an application which published files are behind, which it has edited,
 * and which of the two are both.
 *
 * ## The problem
 *
 * The panel's frontend is published into the application rather than imported
 * from the package. That is the right trade — the component registries are
 * build-time `import.meta.glob` allowlists over the application's own tree,
 * and a component you cannot read the source of is one you cannot debug — but
 * it costs the thing every published-asset design costs: **a package update
 * cannot improve a file the application now owns.**
 *
 * `vendor:publish` alone cannot help, because it has only two settings and
 * both are wrong on an upgrade. Without `--force` it skips every file that
 * exists, so nothing updates. With `--force` it overwrites everything,
 * including the files the project deliberately changed. Neither can tell the
 * difference: "differs from the package's copy" is equally true of a stale
 * file and an edited one.
 *
 * ## The fix
 *
 * `AssetManifest` records what each file looked like *when it was published*.
 * That third value is the common ancestor, and it turns an ambiguous
 * two-way comparison into an unambiguous three-way one — the same move
 * `git merge-base` makes. See that class for the full table.
 *
 * Only two categories are ever written automatically, and in both the
 * application demonstrably has no opinion about the file: one it never had,
 * and one it has never touched. A file edited on both sides is reported with
 * its path and left exactly as it is, because resolving that by guessing is
 * how an upgrade eats somebody's work.
 *
 * ## Translations too, once they are published
 *
 * The frontend is most of what this reports on, but not all of it. An
 * application that published `lang/vendor/panda-panel` to reword a
 * confirmation owns those files the same way, and had the same problem: the
 * copy was frozen at the release it was published from, and every sentence
 * the package improved afterwards stopped at the vendor directory.
 *
 * `PublishedAssets::files()` includes them from the moment that directory
 * exists, so they arrive here with the same seven statuses and the same two
 * rules about which ones may be written. An application that never published
 * them has nothing to report: it reads the package's own copies and is
 * already current by definition.
