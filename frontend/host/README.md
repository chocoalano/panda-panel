# The host seam

Eighteen modules the panel's published components import but do not ship.
They belong to the application: a Laravel Vue starter kit writes most of them,
and [Wayfinder](https://github.com/laravel/wayfinder) generates the rest at
build time from the application's own routes and controllers.

This directory holds a minimal stand-in for each, used **only** when
type-checking and building this package on its own. Nothing here is published,
exported by composer, or reachable from an application — `@/…` resolves to
`resources/js/…` first, and falls through to this directory only when the file
is genuinely not part of the package.

That fall-through is what makes `npm run typecheck` possible at all. Without
it, 337 files would fail to resolve eighteen imports and the toolchain would
report nothing useful about the code it _can_ check.

## Why stand-ins rather than shipping the real thing

Two of these are impossible to ship and the rest would be wrong to:

- `routes/*` and `actions/*` are **generated**. Wayfinder writes them from the
  application's route table, so a copy vendored here would be a snapshot of
  somebody else's routes.
- The components are the application's design. `UserMenuContent` is where a
  project puts its own account links; shipping one would mean overwriting a
  file every starter kit already has, and every project has already edited.

## Keeping the seam honest

A stand-in that drifts from what the starter kit really exports would let a
real breakage type-check clean. Two things guard against that:

- Each stub below declares the **exact** props, emits and exports the panel's
  own components use — no `any` escape hatches on the surface that matters —
  so removing a prop from a stub breaks the build here.
- `php artisan panel:install` checks an application for every one of these
  paths and names the ones it is missing, so the seam is verified where it is
  real rather than only where it is simulated.
